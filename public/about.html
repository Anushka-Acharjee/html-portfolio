<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello Everyone!
  Myself Anushka Acharjee. Currently studying at Third year of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering.
  I'm pursuing my B.Tech Degree from NIT, Agartala.
</p>

<p>This is my first ever website making project and I'm currently looking forward to enhance my knowledge more.
  Previously, I had though coding as a very tough and boring topic. But, then the language
  Arduino truly intrigued me. So, from there Istarted my coding journey.
</p>

<p>And now, I'm working on my web development skills, hoping to create more sophisticated
  and enhanced websites in my future. wishing for well.
  Good Bye!
